# Romi – Smart Voice Assistant App (Flutter)

Romi is a modern, lightweight AI-powered voice assistant built using Flutter.  
It enables fast, natural conversations through voice and text while focusing on simplicity, performance, and user privacy.

Romi listens to voice input, understands user intent, generates intelligent responses using large language models, and speaks back using text-to-speech in real time.
